## Hello there ( ˘▽˘)っ

My name is Alejandro Corvalán, also known as **no7sag**. I got into programming early last year (~March 2021) and nowadays I love it.

I really enjoy learning new technologies and put it into practice. Problem solving is pretty rewarding.

**Happy coding and have a nice day.** ✨
